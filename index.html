We picnicked by the sullen river, its water brown, opaque and dense enough for starving frogs to flop across. I offered you a slice of Sunbeam bread, the last unsoiled food we had. You chewed it out of spite, my routine generosity taken as offense. Whenever one of us moved the weatherworn table creaked and shifted. What good is money to us now? you sighed. Or fidelity? I pretended not to hear, staring at the splinters that hung like fingerlings along your pale, freckled arms. We had nothing worth keeping. Night began prematurely, as it does these days, with rain.

We watch each other in the blue glow of predawn, limbs entwined. We speak with our eyes: “I grow hair on my back now,” I say, “white keratin horns that I pluck when you’re not around. A white picket fence is really a series of spears meant to impale the raised chins of children like ours. Please don’t make me become what I am.” His eyes collect the shell of my body. My words fare the same. “At least your horns are white,” he says. “And in this light, your eyes are almost blue. Let’s dream a while, shall we?”

Marissa and Carlos are in love. She told me. She told me she spends more nights at his place than at hers. “I started keeping a spare toothbrush there,” she said. She smiled a little smile that wasn’t meant for me. Swirled the melting ice in her glass at the restaurant table. We were outside, a gleam of sweat across our bodies. She brought the glass to her lips. Met my eyes.
Later, I told Michael I’d be keeping a toothbrush at his place. From the other room: a huff. I turned on the faucet. Cold, like lips on ice.
